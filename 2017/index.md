## Concepts and Technologies for Distributed Systems and Big Data Processing

The course provides an overview of recent advances in distributed systems for
Big Data processing. The course starts presenting computational models for high
throughput batch processing like MapReduce. Next, we will introduce software
engineering techniques for distributed systems such as REST and component-based
architectures. We will then cover low latency real time stream processing and
complex event processing. Finally, we will present advanced topics in
distributed data-intensive systems, such as geodistribution and security. The
course focuses both on the fundamental concepts as well as on the concrete
technologies and applications of the aforementioned techniques to real-world
case studies.
